# Anthony's Technical Journal

## Week Three: Git/GitHub Adventures Continue, Python Joins the Party 

This past week I spent a large portion of my time playing with the command line in a desperate attempt to make sense of the git commands. Up until now, I haven't had to really Google THAT much stuff when it came to learning code. However, git hath bested me. Thus why I stayed after class this past week to get my GitHub repository all sorted out. Now, writing this journal from my desk at home, I had to rediscover just how we made it work after class. So I did the stuff I remembered, then came the joy of committing things and getting it pushed to GitHub (the fun part). If this journal is posted then pat me on the back because I got it! All throughout my schooling, it was extremey rare for me to take physical notes. However, I found myself pulling out my little Manifold (shameless plug for Matt) notebook and writing directions and code orders. So all in all, I am getting it I think! As far as Python, I haven't hit any speedbumps with it yet. Between workshops and GCDRI, I'm pretty comfortable with the basics!

Hour 1: Git research/notes
Hour 2: Git committing/pushing
Hour 3: Revisiting Python basics
Hour 4: Wrap up, revised goals, wrote weekly technical journal

## Week Two (1/30 to 2/6)

This week, I spent part of my time reviewing Git and the command line, including an hour with the DHRI command line tutorial. I found Git to be tough going, but feel like I made solid progress learning how to use pipes on the command line, though I'm still a little confused on the details of how they work. I also started learning how to run scripts in Python, which was very time consuming.

Hour 1: Git review using Pro Git book
Hour 2: Git review using Pro Git book
Hour 3: Phone call with classmate to fiture out pipes
Hour 4: Tried running a "hello world" Python script
Hour 5: ''
Hour 6: ''
Hour 7: Should have given up, but got the script eworking, though I'm still not sure what went wrong.
