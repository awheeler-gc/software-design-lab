## Week Five: Hyde Has Nothing on the Horrors of Jekyll

So this past week we came to class and conducted our lab portion in which we experimented with Jekyll. I downloaded all of the required software, but I ran into an issue. Every time I closed out the terminal, Jekyll (along with Homebrew and Ruby) would magically vanish. Then I'd redownload it all, and it would work (or at least seem to be working) while I kept that specific terminal window open and continued working from it. I spent a frustrating amount of time trying to resolve this issue. However, I eventually surrendered. I think something that also hindered me was not really understanding the purpose of Jekyll, outside of it being another fancy way of creating this online spaces? I guess it just feels like there is other more simple ways to do it. Maybe Jekyll and I were just never meant to be.

Hour 1: Troubleshooting
Hour 2: Research on said troubleshooting
Hour 3: Troubleshooting some more
Hour 3.5: Giving up, stepping away from the screen, and eating snacks

## Week Four: HTML/CSS and Spider-Man

This past week's class on HTML/CSS was a good refresher for me. I took Patrick Smyth's HTML/CSS workshop back in September 2018, and it was very similar to what we did in class this week. I also conducted similar experimentation with HTML/CSS during the GC Digital Research Institute last month. So after getting some repeated exposure, I went ahead and made a very brutalist, 90's looking website. The theme you ask? The original Spider-Man trilogy and why Toby Maguire as Spider-Man is superior (due to the sheer hilarity of it). The website has some links (that currently lead nowhere) to my opinions on Andrew and Tom's respective performances in their Spider-Man films, and the site is topped off with a wonderful image of Toby from the infamous bar-dance scene from Spider-Man 3. It was fun! I even managed to make some text glide across the screen, which was wild. Definitely a fun experiment!

Hour 1: Structuring HTML Code
Hour 2: Adjusting code to fit desired format for the website
Hour 3: Playing with CSS

## Week Three: Git/GitHub Adventures Continue, Python Joins the Party 

This past week I spent a large portion of my time playing with the command line in a desperate attempt to make sense of the git commands. Up until now, I haven't had to really Google THAT much stuff when it came to learning code. However, git hath bested me. Thus why I stayed after class this past week to get my GitHub repository all sorted out. Now, writing this journal from my desk at home, I had to rediscover just how we made it work after class. So I did the stuff I remembered, then came the joy of committing things and getting it pushed to GitHub (the fun part). If this journal is posted then pat me on the back because I got it! All throughout my schooling, it was extremey rare for me to take physical notes. However, I found myself pulling out my little Manifold (shameless plug for Matt) notebook and writing directions and code orders. So all in all, I am getting it I think! As far as Python, I haven't hit any speedbumps with it yet. Between workshops and GCDRI, I'm pretty comfortable with the basics!

Hour 1: Git research/notes
Hour 2: Git committing/pushing
Hour 3: Revisiting Python basics
Hour 4: Wrap up, revised goals, wrote weekly technical journal

## Week Two (1/30 to 2/6)

This week, I spent part of my time reviewing Git and the command line, including an hour with the DHRI command line tutorial. I found Git to be tough going, but feel like I made solid progress learning how to use pipes on the command line, though I'm still a little confused on the details of how they work. I also started learning how to run scripts in Python, which was very time consuming.

Hour 1: Git review using Pro Git book
Hour 2: Git review using Pro Git book
Hour 3: Phone call with classmate to fiture out pipes
Hour 4: Tried running a "hello world" Python script
Hour 5: ''
Hour 6: ''
Hour 7: Should have given up, but got the script eworking, though I'm still not sure what went wrong.
