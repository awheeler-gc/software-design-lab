## Weeks Nine & Ten: Food with a Dash of SQL

I ask you bare with me here, I've been squeezing in these lab hours between my jobs. I just started working for/joined the CUNY Academic Commons team, so I have been stretched a little thin lately between that, being the program assistant for Digital Humanities and Data Analysis & Visualization, and teaching at LaGuardia! So, for this entry, I went ahead and played with databases, specifically using SQL. 

I started playing a bit with SQL late last semester, then touched based (gently) with it again during the GCDRI this past January. I went ahead and tried creating fields and tables with SQL. I did my best to do it from memory and association, and after a couple hours worth of fiddling with it, I decided to go ahead and refer back to notes from GCDRI.

We had made a table of students, programs, and other academic jargon. So I tried to be a little more creative with it and create a table of foods. I would (attempt) to insert a food into the table and associate it with one of two categories; Italian or Chinese. Then, instead of associating the students with GPA's, I tried to write a query that paired them with general prices.

It was kind of messy, and I had a lot of back and forth, but I sort of created a table? I tried y'all. It will be much easier going over it in class alongside everyone I'm sure, BUT at least I tried to get my toes wet.

Hours 1 & 2: Fiddling with code from memory, rather unsuccesfully 
Hour 3: Figuring out how to create a column dedicated to food genres.
Hour 4: Attempting to write a query associating the food items with a price.
Hour 5: Trying to write queries to reorganize the data.

## Weeks Six & Seven: Rolling the Die at Red Lobster

To preface, these past couple of weeks have been difficult for me in terms of logging on and playing with Python. Thanks to the drastic fulcation of weather, my allergies came in full-swing, which domino-effected into some pre-existing health problems of mine. However, I was able to squeeze at least a few hours in.

A couple weeks back, we made the Magic 9 Ball generator triggered by burning questions, all in Python. So I attempted to do something a little more simple, but still a lot for a newcomer. I tried to make a random dice generator. So essentially, you would "roll!" and it'd give you a random number. This was moderately easy, but then I tried to double the stakes and add another die in, which was unsuccessful.

As for the cafe programming we did last week, I decided to rearrange it to fit a restaurant setting. I swapped the language to fulfill the order of a patron at Red Lobster. I worked at Red Lobster all throughout my four years of undergrad, so I took the ordering process and tried to recreate it using Python. It was honestly pretty difficult. I think it would be easier if we took screenshots of our process during class, so we have some sort of guide to use outside the classroom. Googling helps, but only sometimes.

Hour 1: Magic 9 Ball -> Dice Roll
Hour 2: Double Dice Roll Fail
Hour 3: Switching Language from Cafe -> Red Lobster
Hour 4: Troubleshooting/trying to get the code correct


## Week Five: Hyde Has Nothing on the Horrors of Jekyll

So this past week we came to class and conducted our lab portion in which we experimented with Jekyll. I downloaded all of the required software, but I ran into an issue. Every time I closed out the terminal, Jekyll (along with Homebrew and Ruby) would magically vanish. Then I'd redownload it all, and it would work (or at least seem to be working) while I kept that specific terminal window open and continued working from it. I spent a frustrating amount of time trying to resolve this issue. However, I eventually surrendered. I think something that also hindered me was not really understanding the purpose of Jekyll, outside of it being another fancy way of creating this online spaces? I guess it just feels like there is other more simple ways to do it. Maybe Jekyll and I were just never meant to be.

Hour 1: Troubleshooting
Hour 2: Research on said troubleshooting
Hour 3: Troubleshooting some more
Hour 3.5: Giving up, stepping away from the screen, and eating snacks

## Week Four: HTML/CSS and Spider-Man

This past week's class on HTML/CSS was a good refresher for me. I took Patrick Smyth's HTML/CSS workshop back in September 2018, and it was very similar to what we did in class this week. I also conducted similar experimentation with HTML/CSS during the GC Digital Research Institute last month. So after getting some repeated exposure, I went ahead and made a very brutalist, 90's looking website. The theme you ask? The original Spider-Man trilogy and why Toby Maguire as Spider-Man is superior (due to the sheer hilarity of it). The website has some links (that currently lead nowhere) to my opinions on Andrew and Tom's respective performances in their Spider-Man films, and the site is topped off with a wonderful image of Toby from the infamous bar-dance scene from Spider-Man 3. It was fun! I even managed to make some text glide across the screen, which was wild. Definitely a fun experiment!

Hour 1: Structuring HTML Code
Hour 2: Adjusting code to fit desired format for the website
Hour 3: Playing with CSS

## Week Three: Git/GitHub Adventures Continue, Python Joins the Party 

This past week I spent a large portion of my time playing with the command line in a desperate attempt to make sense of the git commands. Up until now, I haven't had to really Google THAT much stuff when it came to learning code. However, git hath bested me. Thus why I stayed after class this past week to get my GitHub repository all sorted out. Now, writing this journal from my desk at home, I had to rediscover just how we made it work after class. So I did the stuff I remembered, then came the joy of committing things and getting it pushed to GitHub (the fun part). If this journal is posted then pat me on the back because I got it! All throughout my schooling, it was extremey rare for me to take physical notes. However, I found myself pulling out my little Manifold (shameless plug for Matt) notebook and writing directions and code orders. So all in all, I am getting it I think! As far as Python, I haven't hit any speedbumps with it yet. Between workshops and GCDRI, I'm pretty comfortable with the basics!

Hour 1: Git research/notes
Hour 2: Git committing/pushing
Hour 3: Revisiting Python basics
Hour 4: Wrap up, revised goals, wrote weekly technical journal
