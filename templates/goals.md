# Anthony's Course Goals

## Goal One

## Become comfortable with using an array of software development tools and skills. Given my focus is in digital pedagogy, I want to be able to utilize different types of software and technology effectively, given I focus a lot of my research so heavily on students with disabilities and students of color.

## Goal Two

## Gain enough knowledge to develop my own personal digital projects. Thanks to the many influential people I met since starting at The Graduate Center, a great subsection of my research interest now revolves around game studies. I think several of the skills gained from this Software Design Lab could contribute to my ability to expand my skills within game creation with the underlying focus being pedagogically centered.

## Goal Three

## Is it lame or cliche to say have fun? I am a very goal-oriented person, and coding can be a very, very tedious process. So I want to learn how to develop the patience that is required to succeed in this type of work. I want to know how to take it easy and just let the process happen at whatever pace it takes.
